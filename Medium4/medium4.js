/*Create a car object with the items: Make, Model, Year, Milage, and Color. Then create 3 methods in the object; A driveToWork method, driveAroundTheWorld method, and runErrands method. Each of these methods should affect the carâ€™s mileage adding to it each time and console logging the old mileage and the new mileage.
driveToWork = 33 miles
driveAroundTheWorld = 24,000 miles
runErrands = 30 miles 
Example 1:
car.driveToWork();
Output: old mileage: 2000 | new mileagea: 2033
Explanation: 2000 + 33 = 2033
Example 2:
car.driveAroundTheWorld();
Output: old mileage: 2033 | new mileagea: 26033 
Example 3:
car.runErrands();
Output: old mileage: 26033 | new mileagea: 26063
